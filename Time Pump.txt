# Chapter One

"Who are you, and where are you going?" Peculiar phrasing for a police officer, but I seemed to be in a bad part of town. "My name is Kent Summons and I am not going anywhere in particular, just driving around." I knew he wouldn't like that answer but it was the truth. I just moved into town and didn't know anyone so I would spend many evenings just driving around. "Well Joyrider, you need to turn around and go home, this isn't a place for someone like you." Obviously he didn't care who I was, he was just trying to scare me.

It only took ten minutes to get home, which wasn't very helpful for my boredom. I ended up just passing out in front of my computer.

A few weeks later I was again out driving around, late at night like a fool, and realized I was almost out of gasoline. I drove into the little gas station on the next block. It was a good thing it took cards because money was not something I had an abundance of. After dealing with the always horrible experience that is the gas pump interface, I started filling up. Ten dollars... Twenty dollars... and then it stopped.

$28.65

What happened next can only be described as the warmth of a wool blanket. Comfortable but very itchy. I also could not see. 

When my vision returned all I could see was grass with a few tall trees in the distance. My whole body still itched. I thought it must be the grass so I jumped on top of my car to get out of it. Did I black out? Where was I? As I was sitting there I saw someone in the distance running towards me, atleast they might know where I was. After a long and awkward run this random person just stopped twenty feet from my car and said, "Who are you?". "Well, my name is Kent. Do you know where I am?" They did not answer. Suddenly I started feeling warm again and before I knew if I was sitting on my car at the gas station I had just stopped at. If I had been drinking that night it would make more sense but I was stone sober. Worried about my own sanity I immediately drove home and got into bed, the morning would make things better. 

# Chapter Two

*Start sickness writing*

In the following months I found more structure in my life. I got a job, I now sleep a regular night, and I have some friends I can get a beer with from work. Normal. 

The time I spent driving around this city helped me in the long run. Now I know where the best pizza and the cheapest gas is in town. Sometimes I drive through that creepy neighborhood on the East Side just try and piece together what happened that night, but the answer always elludes me. 

At work one day I was given the assignment to determine the best locations in town for a marketing campaign. Looking at a map of this town immediately makes you think of a butterfly. With a river running straight down the center of town it splits the whole town, and each side of the river has its own feel. The West Side has the fancy apartments and high rises on the river with upper-middle class homes extending out in waves only interupted by shopping centers and wide avenues. The East Side is less dense, more sprawling, but still a fine place to live. The houses on the river are large and beautiful with large trees, and extending out from there are some industrial parks and low income housing. Our business is home automation so the West Side was a logical choice for the more affluent customer. However something told me a little advertising on the near East Side might pay off. The people that lived over there didnt have alot of money but they thought about things a little differently. 

The ads ran for a few weeks, giving us a small bump in work on the West Side. After three weeks we started getting a fair amount of calls from the East Side for Package #3, proximity sensors integrated with a security system. The company was happy to have some work on that side of town and seemed to appreciate my foresight into this growing market. I appreciated the recognigiton but I mostly just wondered why this specific package was so popular over there. 

I asked permission to do a little field work so I could meet the customers and take some surveys to better understand this new market. So on Thursday I rode in a truck with an installer named Jake over to the East Side to do a few installs of Package #3. The first install in the morning was for an older lady who was worried about forgeting to lock the doors when she went out. The second install after lunch was a little more insightful. The customer was purchasing our package because he had noticed a growing number of strange looking people roaming the streets. He had kids so it worried him they might wander onto his property. Our third install that day had the same concerns.

*End sickness writing*

The third customer was waiting for us when we drove up at 4:30 pm. The last install of the day always ends up being later than scheduled. Customers don't like it but there is not much you can do with so much uncertainty sprinkled in a days work. This customer however, whose name was Sandy Beachum, was not upset. She had a nervous complexion. Getting to work straight away we got everything installed in record time. She then asked us into her living room for some tea, her demeanor being markedly more intense at this point. What she said next smelled of crazy, but for some reason I sensed some truth in it.

"To much gas, to much time!" she said in a hurried tone. "When they catch you they never let you go, locked away from time for an enternity forever and ever and forever." We tried asking what she was refering to but it seemed to make no difference, as if we were not even there. "Be careful of the Joyriders, they can be your best friend or your biggest nightmare. But ALWAYS make sure to buckle up." It was at that point she finished her tea and ran up the stairs. We would have had to wait had she not prepaid, but as that was the case we got out of there as quickly as possible. Jake said very little on the way back to the shop, I think we were both just trying to make sense of what just happened. 

I occasionally thought of that day for the next few months, but for the most part I let go the mystery behind the crazy woman with the tea. But then, on the 5th of November, I was on the East Side visiting a yard sale I had bookmarked on Search Kea that week when I decided to stop to top off my gas tank. Gasoline was supposed to reach $8 a gallon the next week because of a iceberg floating the wrong way. What that has to do with anything I will never know. Oblivious to the fact this was the very same gas station I had the black out I pulled in. Since my tank was mostly full it only took about $11.74 for the pump to click off. With that loud click came a feeling I had almost forgotten. Warm, itchy... hadn't this happened before? 

I woke up surrounded by horses. Unsure of what had just happened I just start walking towards the nearest structure, which looked to be a barn. As I enter I am greated by the smell of manure, which was expected, but also by filthy men doing all manner of work in a frantic way. Few take notice of me, the ones who do only look frightened because I stand a fair amount taller than them. Exiting the opposite side of the barn brings me to a distant view of a modest size dirt ring with crowds of people surrounding it. As I approach still very few people even acknowledge my existance with eye contact. Only now do I begin to get nervous. Where could I be, and why am I here?

I sit on a rustic wooden bench with a decent view of what appears to be a horse race. Thats when a man dressed a carefully tailored suit sits down next to me. Without turning towards me he asks, "Who are you, and where are you going?" I responded, "Hi, my name is Kent Summons and, well, I am not really sure where I am going because I don't know where I am." "I do say good man, you should very well know where you are, this is quite the spectacle. These are the Newmarket Races!" With that clearing up very little I decided to simply play along in order to end the line of questioning. Atleast I knew where my car was, so I determined I should make my way back to it and try and settle my thoughts. 

Very little sense returned to me in the comfort of my drivers seat, but it did occur to me that I did not see a single other automobile in my short time about, only horses. Everyone seemed to be dressed rather formally aswell. Where in the world was I? That thought did not have time to settle because at that very moment a young woman opened the door on my car and jumped into the passenger seat. "Where yah headed?" she asked in an exuberant tone that while unsettling was also a pinch comforting in its optimisim.
