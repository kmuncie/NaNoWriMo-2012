# Chapter One

"Who are you, and where are you going?" Peculiar phrasing for a police officer, but I seemed to be in a bad part of town. "My name is Kent Summons and I am not going anywhere in particular, just driving around." I knew he wouldn't like that answer but it was the truth. I just moved into town and didn't know anyone so I would spend many evenings just driving around. "Well Joyrider, you need to turn around and go home, this isn't a place for someone like you." Obviously he didn't care who I was, he was just trying to scare me.

It only took ten minutes to get home, which wasn't very helpful for my boredom. I ended up just passing out in front of my computer.

A few weeks later I was again out driving around, late at night like a fool, and realized I was almost out of gasoline. I drove into the little gas station on the next block. It was a good thing it took cards because money was not something I had an abundance of. After dealing with the always horrible experience that is the gas pump interface, I started filling up. Ten dollars... Twenty dollars... and then it stopped.

$28.65

What happened next can only be described as the warmth of a wool blanket. Comfortable but very itchy. I also could not see. 

When my vision returned all I could see was grass with a few tall trees in the distance. My whole body still itched. I thought it must be the grass so I jumped on top of my car to get out of it. Did I black out? Where was I? As I was sitting there I saw someone in the distance running towards me, atleast they might know where I was. After a long and awkward run this random person just stopped twenty feet from my car and said, "Who are you?". "Well, my name is Kent. Do you know where I am?" They did not answer. Suddenly I started feeling warm again and before I knew if I was sitting on my car at the gas station I had just stopped at. If I had been drinking that night it would make more sense but I was stone sober. Worried about my own sanity I immediately drove home and got into bed, the morning would make things better. 

# Chapter Two

Today I have more structure in my life. I found a job, I sleep a regular night, and I have some friends I can get a beer with from work. Normal. 

The time I spent driving around this city helped me in the long run. Now I know where the best pizza and the cheapest gas is in town. Sometimes I drive through that creepy neighborhood on the East Side just try and piece together what happened that night, but the answer always elludes me. 

At work one day I was given the assignment to determine the best locations in town for a marketing campaign. Looking at a map of this town immediately makes you think of a butterfly. With a river running straight down the center of town it splits the whole town, and each side of the river has its own feel. The West Side has the fancy apartments and high rises on the river with upper-middle class homes extending out in waves only interupted by shopping centers and wide avenues. The East Side is less dense, more sprawling, but still a fine place to live. The houses on the river are large and beautiful with large trees, and extending out from there are some industrial parks and low income housing. Our business is home automation so the West Side was a logical choice for the more affluent customer. However something told me a little advertising on the near East Side might pay off. The people that lived over there didnt have alot of money but they thought about things a little differently. 

The ads ran for a few weeks, giving us a small bump in work on the West Side. After three weeks we started getting a fair amount of calls from the East Side for Package #3, proximity sensors integrated with a security system. The company was happy to have some work on that side of town and seemed to appreciate my foresight into this growing market. I appreciated the recognigiton but I mostly just wondered why this specific package was so popular over there. 

I asked permission to do a little field work so I could meet the customers and take some surveys to better understand this new market. So on Thursday I rode in a truck with an installer named Jake over to the East Side to do a few installs of Package #3. The first install in the morning was for an older lady who was worried about forgeting to lock the doors when she went out. The second install after lunch was a little more insightful. The customer was purchasing our package because he had noticed a growing number of strange looking people roaming the streets. He had kids so it worried him they might wander onto his property. Our third install that day had the same concerns.
